Question 2:
I found two issues while examining and compiling the program:
1) The function findFirstAtLeast() called in insert() compares two Coord objects using the '<' operator
See: for (; p != m_head && p->m_value < value; p = p->m_next)

The class Coord does not have a operator< function that overloads '<'.
However, I don't see this as a compilation error in Visual, and as a warning in g32 because there probably is a template function in the standard library that allows this part to compile (although it is probably the wrong implementation).

2) The function insert() itself compares two Coord objects later using '=='.
See: if (p != m_head && p->m_value == value)

The class Coord does not have a 'operator==' function that overloads '=='. The compiler complains about this issue as this time there is neither a function nor template function that is acceptable to compare Coord objects using '=='.
